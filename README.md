# Machine-Learning

From scratch implementations include different ML algorithms I have implemented from scratch to reinforce my understanding of them such as MLPs or Transformers. Pytorch includes different neural networks I have coded for tasks using the PyTorch library.

## From Scratch

### Multilayer Perceptron from scratch
I have implemented a multilayer perceptron from scratch using numpy, learning in more depth how backpropogation and gradient descent actually work as well as different activation and loss functions. It is implemented using OOP so different networks can be implemented if needed, currently one with an input layer with 2 nodes, a hidden layer with 3 nodes and an output layer with 1 node is implemented to simulate an XOR gate. If you give it training data for example

```
0,0,0
0,1,1
1,0,1
1,1,0
```

The first 2 columns being inputs and last column denoting an output it can be trained to simulate an XOR gate. Use at least 10,000+ epochs.

## PyTorch
